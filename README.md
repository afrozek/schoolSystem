# College Statistics
Project 1 for IS218

Your challenge is to create a program that can display an view of records from the Integrated Post Secondary Educational Data System. This process requires you to import a CSV file that contains the data, and a CSV file that is the corresponding data dictionary for that data. You must then display a list of all the colleges by name that has a link to click, which takes you to a detailed table view of that collegeâ€™s records.
